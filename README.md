Joseph Martin - Homework Assignment 1

## Purpose
This purpose of this project was to aid in the education of writing effective html and css tag by means of learning by example. By comparing a pre-exsiting set of code and its tags to my own set of code with equivalent semantic tags, I was able to learn the right and wrong practices when forming usable html and css documentation for future use.
